# In this directory

This repository was created for the purpose of reformatting certain ultraviolet background (UVB) models&mdash;[Faucher-Giguère 2009](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...703.1416F/abstract) (FG09), 
[Haardt and Madau 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...746..125H/abstract) (HM12),
[Puchwein et al](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485...47P/abstract) (PW19)
and [Faucher-Giguère 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.1614F/abstract) (FG20)&mdash;such that each model is in the same units and thus can be utilized in direct comparison between models over a
range of redshifts ($z\approx 10$ to $z=0$).

Additionally, there is code included in this release that runs a [`cloudy_cooling_tools`](https://github.com/brittonsmith/cloudy_cooling_tools)
pipeline to generate ionization tables for different UVB models - i.e., the relative amount of all ionization states for elements that are commonly observed in the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. This code requires
a working installation of CLOUDY, the code for which can be found [here](https://gitlab.nublado.org/cloudy/cloudy).

All of these tools come along with plotting scripts to illustrate a few use cases for
the codes in the directory.

## Directories

### cloudy\_formatted\_data
Stores example data formatted for [`cloudy_cooling_tools`](https://github.com/brittonsmith/cloudy_cooling_tools) to be used by `make_UVB_data_table.py` as input files for reformatting.

### data\_tables
Contains directories for the reformatted UVBs and is the default container 
for generating UVBs via `make_UVB_data_table.py`. The tables show the intensity
(erg $\mathrm{s^{-1}cm^{-2}}$) binned in different energies (eV). This is done for each UVB
over a range of $z\approx 10$ to $z=0$ with some variation between models.

### generate\_ionization\_tables
Code for running `cloudy_cooling_tools` to create ionization tables. Takes in
CLOUDY-formatted data along with a large suite of parameter files that are described
in more detail within that directory.

## Scripts

Several of these scripts have hardcoded paths that need to be edited before they can be run.

### make\_UVB\_data\_table.py
Code for remaking CLOUDY-formatted data into a more user-friendly csv format.

**Arguments:**

* `-out_path`: path to directory where data tables are output. By default is set to output to **data\_tables\_example**

* `-uvb_names`: shorthand names for each UVB. Should be separated by spaces and in the same order as the directory paths in *uvb_paths*

* `-uvb_paths`: paths to directories containing CLOUDY-formatted UVBs. Each path should be separated by a space

**Example**

```
python make_UVB_data_table.py -out_path ./data_table_example/ -uvb_names "fg09 fg20 hm12 pw19" -uvb_paths "./cloudy_formatted_data/fg09 ./cloudy_formatted_data/fg20 ./cloudy_formatted_data/hm12 ./cloudy_formatted_data/pw19"
```

### plot\_uvb\_spec.py
Creates a line plot of UVB intensity for each UVB from $10$ - $10^{2.3}$ eV. Uses
the data output from `make_UVB_data_table.py` (i.e., in the `data_tables` directory)

**Arguments:**

* `-out_path`: path to directory where figures are output

* `-table_dir`: directory where UVB tables have been saved

* `-uvb_names`: shorthand names for each UVB. Should be separated by spaces and should match the names used in *make\_UVB\_data\_table.py*

* `-rs`: redshift to plot. Not all redshifts between UVBs are the same, so will pick the closest redshifts to the selected value for each UVB

**Example**

```
python plot_uvb_spec.py -out_path ./ -table_dir ./data_table_example -rs 2.5
```
